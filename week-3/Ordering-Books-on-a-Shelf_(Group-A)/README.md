Ordering Books on a Shelf
Develop a app to determine the number of possible arrangements of a specific number of books selected from a larger set.

Suppose you have (n) books, and you want to know how many ways you can arrange (r) of them on a shelf. (use permutation dynamic programming)

after that user enters the number of total books that he/she has then enters the group number then the solution will be written bellow after clicking on a submit button.

finally a window will be open that shown the dynamic programming permutation table and the final solution number is in another color

example:
total books: 10, group size: 4, solution: 5040

Requirements:
Main Logic: no libraries is allowed
Backend: Fast-api preferred in case you do client-server
GUI: Tkinter or any other python library, in case you do client-server preferred to use (React, Vue, angular ...etc any front end library) + any UI library (shadcn, Antd, chakra, MUI) + any other UI/Chart library
2 number-inputs for total number of books and the size of a group
a submit button
bellow the form a place that answer is shown
bellow the form say error or some thing nice when the numbers are invalid
open another window to show the permutation table (board)
the solution number should be in different color comparing the other colors
