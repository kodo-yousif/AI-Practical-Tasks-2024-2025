path finder ( Manhattan distance )
Find the path from (S) to (G) using A* algorithm associated with (Manhattan distance) algorithm, the app should display the initial board

user can add nodes (their coordinates and their connections )

the board shows the nodes ( S, A, C ...etc ) and their cost which (Manhattan distance) is used to find the cost of each node

after finding the path open another windows and show the solution paths in order

Requirements:
Initial board is grid based UI
Main Logic: no libraries is allowed
Backend: Fast-api preferred in case you do client-server
GUI: Tkinter or any other python library, in case you do client-server preferred to use (React, Vue, angular ...etc any front end library) + any UI library (shadcn, Antd, chakra, MUI) + any other UI/Chart library
(you can use if you choose web UI) https://anseki.github.io/leader-line/

Use the (Manhattan distance) to find each nodes cost
show the solution paths in order
