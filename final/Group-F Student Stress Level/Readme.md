# Final projects

- Groups should train their own machine learning or deep learning model
- Entire process should be documented via the final report
- The report should include all the machine learning or deep learning related metrics and fields that are related to their project
- Teams are allowed to use any language or framework for their UI implementation
- Teams should only use Python for backend and main logic
- Teams are allowed to use open-cv, sklearn, pytorch and tensorflow for training and all pre-trained models are disallowed
- Dataset provided should be documented in the report as well
- Each Student will be asked around five major questions regarding the written report, the presented slide and/or the Code.
- Present your work in few slides in addition to no more than two pages report.
- each team should have a video of 5m showcasing all their works
