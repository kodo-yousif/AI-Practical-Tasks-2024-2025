# 1. Sudoku 9\*9

Try solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using genetic algorithm.

User can change the initial 9\*9 Sudoku board which is set by you ( you can use some template from internet as initial board) ( initial board is not the goal board, its only a board with some cells predefined and can be changed)

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- try solving a 9\*9 sudoku game
- some of the cells are given and cant be changed ( initial board )
- the app should show each generations best solution with its fitness function result and give ability for the user to select them from a list and see them
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture)

# 2. Jigsaw 20\*20

Try solving a 20\*20 jigsaw puzzle using genetic algorithm.
app should accept an image then split it to 400 pieces and place them randomly

then try to solve it

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- accept an image and spread it randomly on a 20\*20 board ( or any UI )
- solve the Jigsaw game
- the app should save each generations best solution with its fitness function result and user should have the ability to see them from a list and display them on the board.
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture)

# 3. N-Bishop puzzle

Use a genetic algorithm to place as many bishops as possible on a chessboard without any bishop threatening another.

Display the solutions on a chess board, and give the ability to show drafted solutions also

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- the app should save each generations best solution with its fitness function result and user should have the ability to see them from a list and display them on the board.
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture)

# 4. PSO Visualization ( Simulation )

create a app where it shows the PSO particles movement where they reach the goal. ( PSO simulation)

the particles are placed near each other randomly ( N particles ).
the goal and other parameters will be entered by the user. ( any formula parameters, and goal position )

user can set the animations speed so he/she can see the movement more clearly

and save the particle positions on each iteration and give ability for the user to select them and place them on the UI

give each particle a color or any thing else so that user can separate them from each other

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- randomly place particles
- the goal position and other parameters are entered by the user
- the goal is in another color
- animation speed ( will be set by the user )
- the app should save each generations best solution with its fitness function result and user should have the ability to see them from a list and display them on the UI.
- no library should be used for implementing PSO formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )

# 5. Random Chess Board challenge

Place every piece of chess peaces randomly for both sides ( black and white ) using genetic algorithm

## Rules:

- white will move next
- if any white pieces is under attack it must be defended by another piece
- if any black pieces is under attack it must be defended by another piece
- black king must not be checked or checkmated
- white king must not be checkmated
- each side has flexibility to have lost 0-5 pieces
- maximum 1 king
- maximum 1 queen
- maximum 2 knights
- maximum 2 rooks
- maximum 2 bishops
- maximum 8 pawns

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- the app should save each generations best solution with its fitness function result and user should have the ability to see them from a list and display them on the board.
- no library should be used for implementing KNN formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )

# 6. Magic Square Puzzle

Solve a 3x3 Magic Square puzzle, where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal equals the same value, using a genetic algorithm.

Search for magic square on the internet

## Rules

- allowed numbers are n > 0
- no number duplication

## Requirements:

- main logic must be in Python
- the app should save each generations best solution with its fitness function result and user should have the ability to see them from a list and display them on the board.
- no library should be used for implementing KNN formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )
